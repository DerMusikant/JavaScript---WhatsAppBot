# Whatsapp
Basic bot for whatsapp messages

Just testing pedroslopez' whatsapp-web.js

currently capable of answering 'hola', 'chau' and replying 'ping'.
Might practice a bit of media files later idk


To start, install the project and do the following in the terminal (located in the root folder).

1- Execute 'node index.js'

2- Scan the QR Code in your phone's whatsapp (In case you already did, the session will be archived in session.json)

3- In case you would like to close this whatsapp instance, there are 2 options:
    a- From your phone.
    b- Delete session.json from this project.
